Installation log
----------------

OS chosen:
Debian GNU/Linux 7.5 system (codename “wheezy”), for the 64-bit PC (“amd64”) architecture

Installation route:
DVD iso

The OS was downloaded from www.debian.org 
This was a DVD image via HTTP/FTP
The link used was
http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/7.5.0/amd64/iso-dvd/

The iso was burned to a DVD

This DVD was inserted into the Dell machine and the graphical installation was used
from the boot menu.

American English was selected for the keyboard layout.
American English was selected for the language.
The timezone was set to Pacific time.

We chose to use the guided install - in terms of partitioning.
At the Partition Disks screen, we selected Guided - use entire disk
If the computer has multiple hard disks, it may present more than one option in the next screen.
However since ours only shows one, we select the only device - the HDD
*NOTE - AS THE INSTALLER SAYS, THIS OPTION WIPES THE ENTIRE DRIVE TO PLACE DEBIAN ON IT*
In the process it also created a swap and boot partition, it did not ask for size, so it probably bases the size off the hard disk used.

The hostname was created.
The root user was created and a password was chosen.

A user account was created.

Beyond the standard desktop environment software package on the DVD, the ssh server
package was also installed.

Grub was also installed.

Upon reboot the mirror list for repo's for the apt package manager was edited at 
/etc/apt/sources.list 

This was to enable it to also include proprietary blobs. 
This was done with vi.
