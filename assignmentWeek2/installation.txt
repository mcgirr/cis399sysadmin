The iso was burned to a DVD

This DVD was inserted into the Dell machine and the graphical installation was used
from the boot menu.

American English was selected for the keyboard layout.
American English was selected for the language.
The timezone was set to Pacific time.

We chose to use the guided install - in terms of partitioning.
This used the entire disk and automatically partitioned it to only use Debian.
In the process it also created a swap and boot partition.

The hostname was created.
The root user was created and a password was chosen.

A user account was created.

Beyond the standard desktop environment software package on the DVD, the ssh server
package was also installed.

Grub was also installed.

Upon reboot the mirror list for repo's for the apt package manager was edited at 
/etc/apt/sources.list 

This was to enable it to also include proprietary blobs. 
This was done with vi.
